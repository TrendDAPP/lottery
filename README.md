## Lottery
A decentralized lottery app running on the Ethereum network, where you can easily participate by connecting your crypto wallet and buying tickets. After the specified lottery duration, a winner is chosen with a random number generated by Chainlink.

Building a DAPP(Decentralized Application) on Ethereum includes two major steps:
1. Writing a smart contract and deploying it to Ethereum.
2. Interacting with the data and smart contract on Ethereum.

## Interacting with the data and smart contract on Ethereum:

No matter what programming language you are using, in order to make a request to the Ethereum network, you'll need:

|Name                  |Description                                                                                        |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|RPC Provider          |A node(server) that is connected to the Ethereum network, and listens to the incoming RPC requests.|
|Smart Contract ABI    |An interface that defines all methods with arguments available in the smart contract.              |
|Smart Contract Address|An address that is used to find the smart contract runner nodes in the Ethereum network.           |
|User's Private Key    |A private key that is used to sign/verify the write requests(transactions).                        |
